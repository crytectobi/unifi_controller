# unifi_controller_facts - UniFi Controller Facts Ansible Module

This project is to extend the UniFi Controller API and consume it via a native Ansible module.
There are a few difficulties with this sort of thing, first being the lack of UniFi Controller API documentation.  It's pretty much non-existant.  This project is largely based on this project: [https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client/], this is basically a Python port of that client, you may notice many similarities.

## What does this do?
This module provides a simple, yet needed extension of the UniFi Controller API.  With this module, you can query your UniFi Controller and gather facts and information.  This module doesn't have many actions (read: none), the primary purpose is to gather information from the UniFi Controller.  In order to manipulate your UniFi Controller, you'll need my unifi_controller Ansible module (coming soon).

## Instructions
1) Download, fork, obtain this source code somehow
2) Load it onto a machine that has Ansible installed
3) Note the test.yml file for examples on how to use the module

## Example

```yaml
- name: Get User List
  unifi_controller_facts:
    controller_baseURL: "https://127.0.0.1:8443"
    controller_username: "admin"
    controller_password: "changeme"
    controller_site: "default"
    query: list_users
  register: returnedData
```

## Known Issues
* Documentation in embedded in the module script.  It should be copied and compiled externally probably a bit better...
* There are a few untested functions that I don't have the current capacity to fully develop/test, being that I lack a USG, and only have 2 UAPs.  If anyone would like to contribute code to support the UniFi switches, and cameras, etc, or maybe donate a device, that'd be much appreciated.
* There are also a few functions that seem to have been broken/made unavailable in the version of the UniFi Controller I operate (my setup isn't that old, I've only tested the 5.8.x line)
